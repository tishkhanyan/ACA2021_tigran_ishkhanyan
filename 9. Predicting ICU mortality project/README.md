This was a two-week group project on predicting in-hospital mortality.
First we've tried different approaches to data cleaning and preprocessing, then applied big set of ML algorithms as well as ensemble methods. Our final result on unseen test data was in top-3 on the leaderboard.

PS This was a joint project with @GevorgAghekyan, @HMkrtich, @MariaHov and me.
