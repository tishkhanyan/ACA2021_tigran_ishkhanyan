1. Implemented KMeans algorithm from scratch for random and kmeans++ centroid initializations. 
2. Implemented GMM from scratch for random mean, variance and pi; random mean; random divide and k-means initializations.
3. Tried out agglomerative and DBScan clustering algorithms.

Also, compared my algorithms with sklearn's built-in ones to check if mine are good.
