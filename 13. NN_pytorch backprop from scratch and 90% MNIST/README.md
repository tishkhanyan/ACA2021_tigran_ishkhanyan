The idea was to implement NN from scratch using pytorch. 
1. For this, theoretical derivations of backpropogation are given at assignment0_differentiation.ipynb
2. layers are written in assignment1_modules.ipynb

Results are tested in assignment2_main.ipynb where I got 90% accuracy on MNIST dataset using my neural net.
